				<h2><span class="date">9/19/2016</span><span class="title">My First Blog Post</span></h2>
				<p>Today I am starting my newest adventure: creating an online resume and portfolio for my Front-End Web Development class.  Instead of going right into the html for all of the pages, I decided I'm going to sketch each page out first.  In my User Experience Design and Product Managment classes, we do this to work out most of the kinks.  While I'm sure I will have many "kinks" once I put my sketches into html, I'm hoping that this will make it a little bit easier since I will have a vision for each page.</p>
				<p>Today I have made the navbar and obviously this page.  I used a navbar from Bootstrap, but I edited it to make it the way that you see.  So far, something that I have struggled with today is making the layout of this page.  I struggled placing each blog post on opposite sides of the page, but I didn't want them next to each other.  To figure this out, I used lorem ipsum as a placeholder for my second blog.  I then played around with the different bootstrap grid systems until I got the layout the way I wanted it.  I realize that a lot of building this website will be trial and error.  I am really excited to see how it turns out!</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/18/2016</span><span class="title">Woops, 1 Month Later</span></h2>
				<p>Today I put together the about me page. It was easier for me because I already had the nav bar created.  Also because I had already done this page, it was easier to see how I wanted to do my CSS.  I also did some of the home page.  However, now I am stuck on the resume part of the webpage.  I am unsure how I want to format the different sections.  Some of the sections have more than others so I think that I will be able to have an easier time formating those, but for something like the contact me page, I have no idea what to do.  For now, I am just going to put in the basic HTML into each Resume section.  I am also doing a lot of thinking about what I want to do with JavaScript.  I think that I want to do a carousel with some pictures, and maybe put some animation on the blog posts.  I seem to really understand JavaScript in class, but when I go home to do it, I get really confused and have no idea what is going on.</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/20/2016</span><span class="title">Making Progress? Part 1</span></h2>
				<p>Before beginning to do any work today, I planned out a homework schedule for the weekend.  Along with this project, I have 3 others also due next week.  Typical me to leave them all to the last minute.  In the schedule for today for this project, I planned to sketch out all of the pages of this website and to obviously blog about it.  When I went to sketch out the pages, I realized that there were things I want to change on some of the pages already finished.  I also started to think about different formats and different type of content I wanted on each page.  So instead of sketching like I originally planned to, I made a list of everything I can think of at the moment that I want to chang on each page or do on each page.  I also decided that I am not going to add any JavaScript to anything until I'm completly done with everything else.  Going with save the hardest for last route now.</p>
				<p>So how am I feeling?  Becasue on top of this project I have 3 others to work on, I am feeling pretty overwhelmed right now.  Making my schedule and listing out everything I want to add to this project really helped that overwhelming feeling.  When I break things down into small pieces, I have an easier time getting everything done.  I also think that I get everything done with better quality when I am more organized, but you tell me.  How's this website looking?</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/20/2016</span><span class="title">Making Progress? Part 2</span></h2>
				<p>I have come across something new that I am struggling with.  When you are in a page of this website, the navbar tab is highlighted.  However, when you are inside one of the specific Resume tabs, Resume is not highlights, only the specific tab.  I want Resume to be highlighted as well so the user can see where they are in the webpage.  Unfortunately, I cannot seem to figure out how to do do that.  I added the class that all the other pages have when selected, that didn't work.  I tried to add CSS coloring and that didn't work.  My teacher tried helping and she couldn't figure it out either.  We think that it will need to be done in JavaScript, but since I'm saving that for last, we won't figure out if that works until the end.</p>
				<p>Today I also edited the project page.  I sent all of my projects that weren't already there to GitHub and added them to GitHub pages so I could attach the links to the page.  I then took screenshots of all the projects and put them with the links.  I had some formatting issues, but for the most part I got it how I want it to look.  I'm sure that as time goes on I'll change the format some more, but at least for now there is content there and it looks good!</p>
				<p>Well in the process of making the projects page, I see that I broke my blog page! Oh no!!  My formatting is all messed up and I have no idea what I did.  The worst thing for me is when I change something and I don't know what I changed.  It's really frustrating, but I guess that's the point of this.</p>
				<p>Well as you can see, the format of this is correct!  I figured out what I did!  That's the best part of this.  I changed the name of the class that each blog post was in.  I guess that since it's a Bootstrap code, changing the class messed up the format.  Thats good to know for the future!</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/21/2016</span><span class="title">Resume Dropdown</span></h2>
				<p>Today I worked on all of the Resume sections.  I already had all the HTML written in, so all that was left was the formatting.  I was planning on sketching it all out, but once I sat down, the way I wanted it formatted just came to me.  I think I like the way it looks.  I might change the colors around a little.  Something that I've noticed is that when you are working on something for long, its good to work on something else for a little to take a break.  Then go back and look at your work and that way you can really see if it is what you like.</p>
				<p>Last night in the projects page, I only put in some of my Front-End Web Development projects.  I'm still trying to decide if I want to add every project we worked on this term and if I want to add my projects from my other classes.  I feel like I should put my other projects because I want to use this website to put on my resume, and having my other projects on there will show other things I am capable of.  I still need to edit the format of the projects page and add more descriptions, but at least it is all coming along.</p>
				<p>Since I've spent so many hours working on this project today, my goal for today is to complete all of the CSS on all of the dropdown pages, or at least half.  My goal by Tuesday is to have all of the HTML and CSS done, that way I can spend 3 days working on the JavaScript.  Who knows, maybe I'll finish all of the HTML and CSS before then and have more time for JavaScript.</p>
				<p>Yay me!  I finished all of the HTML and CSS on the experience, education and leadership pages.  I added the logos for my jobs, schools and sorority.  Adding the logos took me a long time because I had to size them correctly and then add padding.  I am really happy with how they turned out and I can't wait to see how the next 3 come out tomorrow!</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/22/2016</span><span class="title">Resume Dropdown Part 2</span></h2>
				<p>Today I am working on finishing the all the resume dropdown pages.  The contact me, interests, and skills pages seem to be more difficult because they have less on them.  Because I already have my fonts picked out for the resume pages and I have 3 of the pages formatted, I am going to try to follow the same formation on today's 3 pages.  It's going to be a little tricky since there aren't a lot of words or sections.  So off I go!</p>
				<p>Lucky me, I think I finished all the formatting for every page in the Resume Dropdown.  I am not sure how much I'm loving the skills page, but I've been thinking about it for days and this is the best I can come up with for now.  Who knows, maybe while I'm adding in my JavaScript I'll figure out a different way to format it, but for now I'm pretty happy with the way it looks.</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/22/2016</span><span class="title">Not Working on the Resume Dropdown Anymore: Calls for a Same Day New Blog Post</span></h2>
				<p>I decided that I am going to add all of my projects to this webiste.  I mean this is my online resume and portfolio.  Doesn't that mean that everything should be on it?  I think so.  In order to add my other projects, I added my course names with descriptions to the projects page.  While currently the only projects uploaded are my front-end web design, by the time that you're seeing this, all my projects will be there!</p>
				<p>Adding the course names and descriptions wasn't hard because the page is already formatted.  The hardest part of that was actually writing what the course descriptions are.  I think that I need better descriptions of each of my projects that I already uploaded, but that will come with time, meaning when I decide to not be so lazy and actually write better ones.  Again, they'll already be the best descriptions by the time you're reading them.</p>
				<p>One goals from this point on for this website for today is to improve my about me page.  For example, the formatting needs some work.  I also need to add more content to the page.  Another goal I am setting for myself today is to pick all of the images that I am planning to put on the home page carousel, (yay something fun!!!).  Lastly, in hopes of finishing my product management presentation today, I will add that to the projects page.  I try to set at least 3 goals each day for this website.  For me thats the best way to be sure that I'm getting everything I want done.  Checking each item off my check list one at a time!</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/22/2016</span><span class="title">That Blog Post Was Too Long to Continue, So Here's a Third!</span></h2>
				<p>What do people even put in an about me?  I don't want to be repetitive and put things in there that will be seen in another page.  I know that some things have to be repetitive, but not everything!  I somewhat fixed the format, but it's not exactly how I want it.  Since I can't figure out what else to put in the about me, I can't get the format to look the way I want.  I'm going to come back to that another day.  Gotta put some thought into what to write!  Now for the fun part: Picking Pictures!!</p>
				<p>Well I just added my first JavaScript function!  After picking the pictures I decided that it wasn't enough to just pick them, I had to put them in a carousel.  Well an hour later, and my home page has a carousel of pictures!  That's really exciting for me because we haven't used the carousel function yet so I had to learn it on my own, using bootstrap of course.  Although, watching the pictures going on the loop is starting to make me dizzy, so I think I should stop.  The last thing on my checklist for today I don't think I am going to have time to get done, at least not in this sitting, so that means more to come tomorrow!</p>

				<h2><span class="date">10/23/2016</span><span class="title">Day 4 of Nothing but this Website</span></h2>
				<p>Not to self: Stop proscratinating everything that you do!!  While I did try to start this website about a month ago, me being me, didn't do anything except that day.  Now I'm stuck doing all 4 of my projects at the same time.  I made a schedule the other day, but I haven't really stuck to it all to well so I just changed it around.  My next couple days are going to be pretty jam packed with homework, but I guess that's what school is all about.  And if its not, don't tell me otherwise.</p>
				<p>So far today I have made some minor changes to formatting.  On the projects page I made it so when you click on the images, you are brought to the actual project.  I also made it so it opens into another tab instead of on the same page.  I thought it was going to be super complicated, but it was just adding a simple tag.  My goals for today are to finish any formatting that I don't like at the moment, because pretty much everything is done (yay) and then add some more JavaScript.  Since right now I only have a couple things I want to add JavaScript to, I think I'll be able to get it done today.  I also want to work on my other presentations today since I haven't worked on them in a couple days.  Wish me luck!  I'll let you know how it all works out!</p>
